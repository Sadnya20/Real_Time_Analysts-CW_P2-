## 📈 Forecasting Trends with Data-Driven Predictions  
The **"Forecasting Total Streams Over Time"** graph helps predict future listening trends, assisting **music labels, producers, and artists** in strategizing their content and marketing.  

> A decline in streams towards 2025 suggests a possible market shift, signaling a need for **adaptation in music production, promotion, or platform engagement strategies**.

## 🎵 Genre-Specific Popularity Analysis  
By analyzing genres across **high, medium, and low popularity categories**, this dashboard helps **record labels, producers, and marketers** tailor their investments.  

- **Genres like Electronic, Pop, and Hip-Hop** lead in streams, indicating they are the most consumed.  
- **Less popular genres like Jazz, R&B, and Reggae** may require better promotion or niche targeting.  
---
## 🔄 Interactive & Filterable for Personalized Insights  
Users can **filter data** by **Release Year, Genre, Label, and Popularity Category**, making it easy to analyze specific trends.  

✅ Businesses can **compare music trends** across different years and genres dynamically.

## 🎯 Strategic Decision-Making for the Music Industry  

- **Streaming platforms (like Spotify)** can recommend songs based on **trending patterns**.  
- **Artists and Record Labels** can align their **releases and marketing efforts** with high-growth genres.  
- **Advertisers** can choose the right genre for **targeted promotions** based on engagement trends.  

### 🎯 Decision-Making Value
